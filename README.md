## Game Background
Year 2500 - The Earth is a sad and lonely place, where living is no longer worth... if it wasn't for a group of hallucinogenic mushroom consumers who appeared few years ago. They started gathering followers, making bets on dreadful and dangerous skating races that frequantly ended up with the demise of their participants. Over the years, X-Kating, as it became popularly known, has developed into an illegal extreme sport higly waged. Nowadays, hundreds of people devote their lives to it and numeours urban tribes have risen up. They gather up lots of supporters who run and bet, in a highly desperate attemp to fill their lives in a **wasted** world.
